# To-Do App (using Context-API and Local-Storage)

This project was created to strengthen my fundamentals of React and `Context-API`, and learn to implement `Local-Storage` in React.
Thanks a lot to [Sir. Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@HiteshChoudhary) for becoming a wonderful teacher and giving me valuable insights and guidance on React and other Web Development technologies.

## Learnings:
- Understanding the Context API for state management in React.
- Implementing Local Storage for persistent state.
- Building a To-Do application with React with main functionalities: adding, reading, toggling, editing, and removing tasks.
